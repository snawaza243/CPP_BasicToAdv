decoding artificial intelligence

1.1 decoding artificial intelligence

1.2 meaning, scope and stages of artificial intelligence

artificial intelligence: according to the dictionary, artificial intelligence is the capability of a machine to imitate human behavior.

ai is the intelligence exhibited by machines
it is based on the premise that intelligence is not real or human
mimics cognitive functions exhibited by humans

scope of ai
1.2 stages of AI

2015 artificial narrow intelligence
2020 artificial general intelligence
2050 artificial super intelligence


2015 artificial narrow intelligence
ani 

user driven big data systems for machine learning
are limited to one or two functional area

are no t self areas of self conscious 
appear to be making decisions but it is the statistic / in action
example
smartphone apps
chess and alpha-go
image identification tools
speech recognition tools self driving system
google translate
spm filters

2020 artificial general intelligence agi
advanced networks trained to build ad hoc systems and improve themselves using data.

cover areas
reasoning
problem solving
abstract thinking

example
multipurpose systems
systems with human level intelligence reasoning thinking and decisions making
systems that synthesize diverse information and decide actions


2050 artificial super intelligence asi
surpasses human intelligence
machine consciousness
systems characterizing cognitive self learning

example
super intelligence au agents
systems that are master at every skill, subject, or discipline and are faster that the smartest humans

1.4 application of artificial intelligence
machine learning - deep learning, neural networks
vision - image and pattern recognition
hearing - voice and speech recognition
natural language processing (NLP) - natural language understanding (NLU), natural language generation (NLG)
robotics
expert systems


1.5
image recognition
product analytics
a/b testing 
speech recognition
language translation
sentiment analysis


image recognition
recognizes objects, places, people, and actions in an image.

speech recognition
allows human to use their voice to communication with software.

language translate
translates a word or sentence from one language to another
ensures that the translated word is culturally and linguistically correct.

product analytics
enables companies to leverage data to reveal user engagement with products or services
tracks activities, likes and dislike of user

a/b testing
compares two versions
determines the version of a web page that delivers a better performance

sentiment analysis
analyzes a piece of text ot determine the writer's attitude
can be categorized as positive, negative or neutral

1.6 ai example
cogito : improve customer support represntatives
netflix : user predictive technology to offer mvie recommendantions



1.7 effects of ai on society
enhances throughput and efficiency

datmo

enhances lifestyle

enhances throughput and efficiency
self driving compares are a combination of sensors, cameras, radar and artificial intelligence technology.
it is capable of sensing the environment and navigating without human intervention.

frees up humans
due company
machines allow humans to do the most interpersonal and creative aspects of work.

cctv
designed to monitor specific areas and situations
alerts relevant personnel to potential hazards or safety incidents

adds jobs and strengthens the economy
pwc - the unparalleled combination of human and machine will become the new normal in the workforce of the future.



Headlines like "robots and ai will destroy jobs" are more of a fiction than fact.

there will be a gradual, posistive evalutaiton ifn the job market
people will work batter with the helop of ai

enhance lifestyle
tsunami - Naresh solving
smart homes will reduce the energy usage and provide better security for hymans. marketing will be more targeted and health care will become more effective with smart devices.

1.8 supervises learning for telemedicine
artificial intelligence has the potential to extend knowledge and understanding to a broader population. image based ai diagnoses of medical conditions could allow for a more comprehensive deployment of telemedicine.


google deepmind
better diagnoses with less human effort
diagnoses diabetic retinopathy like highly trained opthalmologist
diagnoses, monitors, and treats diabetic retinopathy remotely via telemedicine.

1.9 solves complex social problems

litterati 
a litter free world

is a global database for litter
is a crowdsourced litter clean up appear
identifies litter type, distribution, and location
finds more sustainable solutions
one piece of litter at a time

improves demand side management

clrearesult - greg sarich
from an energy standpoint, artificial intelligence can be used to analyze and research historical data to determine how to most efficently distribute energy loads from a grid perspective.

machines become starter over time 
computer s are not suspceptible to human errors


energy efficiency
demand side management
demand response


nest 
alphabet nest uses ai to learn a home oener's habits resulrting in reduced energy consumption

comfy
comfy offers serives for redcing energy consummption in office building


ai at home : soli
embedded into wearables, phone, computers, cars, iot devices
is a miniature radar that detects touchless gesture interacions
incorporates the entire sencor and antenna array into a compact 8mm x 10mm package.
mimics physical interactions with devices


1.10 benefits multiple industries

qualys - mark butler
ai risks are real if we don't understand the quality of the incoming data and set ai rules which are making granular trade-off decsions art increaisng computing speeds.

charcet/ facial recognition
digital content analysis
accuracy in idenfiying patterns

biometric technology used to identify human faces
used in secutiy systems 
commercial identificatoin and marketing

differentiates between images fo objects pets, sports, and food
suggests relevant borders and stickers
identifies uour locatoin and suggest location-based filtersuses machine learning and an image classification technique called convolutions neural networks (CNN)
generates revenue from brands that sposor them based on suers locations


cognitivie scale - ganesh padmanbhan
ai intelligence is the biggest opportunity of our lifefime to extend and expand human creativity and ingenuity.


separation/ retirement
compliance and reporting
risk management
engagement and recognition
performance management
learning and development
recruitment
